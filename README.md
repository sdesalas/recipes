2. Generously butter six non-stick friand or muffin tins. 

**To make the cakes:** 

1. Melt the butter & set aside to cool.
2. Sift the icing sugar & flour into a bowl. Add the almonds & mix everything between your fingers to combine & remove lumps..
3. Whisk the egg whites in another bowl until they form a light, floppy foam. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, tip in the egg whites and lemon zest, then lightly stir in the butter to form a soft batter.
4. Divide the batter between the tins. Sprinkle a handful of blueberries over each cake and bake for 15-20min or until just firm to the touch and golden brown. Cool in the tins for 5 min, then turn out and cool on a wire rack.
