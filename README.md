## Blueberry Frianss

Serves 6 muffins

### Total time: 40min

These blueberry friands are great, a bit like muffins but more solid and stocky.

**Ingredients**

*   100g/4oz unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing
*   125g/4 ½oz icing sugar, plus extra for dusting
*   25g/1oz plain flour
*   85g/3oz ground almonds
*   3 egg whites
*   Grated zest 1 unwaxed lemon
*   85g/3oz blueberries

**To prepare:**

1. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6 
2. Generously butter six non-stick friand or muffin tins. 

**To make the cakes:** 

1. Melt the butter & set aside to cool.
2. Sift the icing sugar & flour into a bowl. Add the almonds & mix everything between your fingers to combine & remove lumps..
3. Whisk the egg whites in another bowl until they form a light, floppy foam. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, tip in the egg whites and lemon zest, then lightly stir in the butter to form a soft batter.
4. Divide the batter between the tins. Sprinkle a handful of blueberries over each cake and bake for 15-20min or until just firm to the touch and golden brown. Cool in the tins for 5 min, then turn out and cool on a wire rack.
5. To serve, dust lightly with icing sugar
